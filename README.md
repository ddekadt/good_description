This [paper](https://github.com/ddekadt/good_description/blob/main/good_description_ddk_agb.pdf) challenges the idea that descriptive research is a lesser form of social scientific inquiry. Good description is a core component of empirical research. We propose a framework for evaluating descriptive _questions_ and _analyses_, emphasizing that good descriptive research questions propose to uncover phenomena in need of explanation, build theory, or help evaluate theoretical claims. We outline a conceptual ladder of research questions and clarify the distinction between descriptive and causal questions through the criterion of manipulability.

We articulate three ideal characteristics of good descriptive analysis: clarity, comparability, and completeness. Clear description is tightly linked to theory and precisely framed, comparable description considers contextual meaning and measurement across cases, and complete description strives for breadth and depth in coverage. Good description as a rigorous and valuable scientific endeavor, providing both researchers and evaluators with tools to distinguish high-quality descriptive work from mere empirical reporting.
